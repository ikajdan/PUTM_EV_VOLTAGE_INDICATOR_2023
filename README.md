# Voltage Indicator

This repository contains the hardware design files for a voltage indicator used in the accumulator of a Formula Student electric vehicle. The voltage indicator is a safety feature that provides a visual indication when the voltage exceeds a safe threshold. The voltage indicator is designed to meet the requirements of the Formula Student EV rulebook and ensure the safety of the accumulator during operation.

The rules state that the connection status must be clearly visible, and electrically controlled switches are not allowed. A visible indicator, such as a voltmeter or red LED, must illuminate when voltage exceeds 60 V DC or half the maximum TS voltage. This indicator must be clearly marked as a "Voltage Indicator", visible during disconnection, and function independently of software control, always powered by the TS, even when the accumulator is removed.
